# A/B Testing Marketing Strategy: Driving Conversions with Data

## Project Overview:
In this project, I simulate the role of a marketing analyst at a digital-first beauty brand. The company recently launched a new advertising strategy aimed at improving user conversion. Using a dataset of over 500,000 users divided into a "test" (ad) group and a "control" (psa) group, I apply A/B testing methodology to evaluate campaign effectiveness.

## Goals:
- Measure whether the new ad strategy leads to higher conversion rates
- Use statistical testing to validate findings
- Deliver actionable recommendations to the business team

## Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Statsmodels

This project blends **data science**, **digital marketing**, and **business storytelling**—a hands-on example of how marketing analysts drive decisions in today’s data-driven world.

## How to Run:
